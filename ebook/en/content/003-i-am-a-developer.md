## I am a Developer

Since you want to become a DevOps engineer, you should have a good understanding of software development. This section is about the general knowledge a DevOps engineer should have from software development perspective.

### What is software development?

Software development is the process of designing, specifying, programming, documenting, testing, and maintaining applications, frameworks, or software components. It involves the systematic use of scientific and technical knowledge to meet specific objectives or requirements, leading to a final product in the form of software applications or tools.

### What knowledge do you need from the Development world?

You should have a good understanding of the following topics:

-   **Programming languages:**  DevOps engineers need to be proficient in at least one programming language, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. They should also be familiar with other programming languages that are commonly used in the development world, such as C/C++, PHP, and Ruby.
-   **Version control systems:**  DevOps engineers need to be familiar with version control systems such as Git and Mercurial. Version control systems allow teams to track changes to code and collaborate on development projects.
-   **Build tools:**  DevOps engineers need to be familiar with build tools such as Maven and Gradle. Build tools automate the process of compiling code and creating executable files.
-   **Deployment tools:**  DevOps engineers need to be familiar with deployment tools such as Ansible and Chef. Deployment tools automate the process of deploying software applications to production servers.
-   **Testing tools:**  DevOps engineers need to be familiar with testing tools such as JUnit and Selenium. Testing tools help to ensure that software applications are working as expected before they are deployed to production.

### Best Programing Languages

While the best language can be subjective and depends on the specific use case, some commonly recommended languages for DevOps are:

-   **Python:** Due to its versatility and extensive libraries, Python is often used in automation scripts, web development, and even machine learning.
-   **Javascript:**
    -   **Node:** A runtime that lets you execute JavaScript on the server-side.
    -   **Typescript:** A superset of JavaScript, adding static types.
-   **Go:** Known for its performance and efficiency, especially in building system tools.
-   **Ruby:** Particularly known for its use in infrastructure automation with tools like Chef and Puppet.
-   **Bash/Shell Scripting:** Crucial for automating tasks in Unix-based systems.

### Programming Basics

The following are some of the essential programming basics that all DevOps engineers should know:

-   **Variables:** Variables are used to store data in a program.
-   **Functions:** Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be used to perform specific tasks.
-   **Control flow:** Control flow statements allow developers to control the order in which code is executed.
-   **Data structures:** Data structures are used to organize data in a program.
-   **Algorithms:** Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems.

#### Progamming Advanced

Some of the more advanced programming topics that DevOps engineers may need to know include:

-   **Object-oriented programming:** Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that allows developers to create reusable and maintainable code.
-   **Design patterns:** Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.
-   **Test-driven development:** Test-driven development is a software development methodology that focuses on writing tests before writing code.
-   **Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD):** CI/CD is a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications.

### Programming in DevOps

DevOps engineers use programming languages and tools to automate and streamline the software development process. Some of the specific tasks that DevOps engineers may use programming for include:

-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Scripting and automating infrastructure deployments, e.g., using Terraform or Ansible.
-   **Configuration Management:** Ensuring servers and systems are set up correctly and consistently, using tools like Puppet or Chef.
-   **Automation:** Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks or to integrate different tools together.
-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
-   **Monitoring and Logging:** Writing scripts or using tools to monitor systems and applications, and to log important events.
